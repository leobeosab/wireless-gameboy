## Wireless Gameboy Project

Still not sure why I made this project. 

This repo is for a gameboy advance SP that's buttons are connected via optocouplers to a generic ESP8266. 
The ESP8266 puts out a WiFi network named "gameboy wifi" and allows a user to connect at "192.168.4.1" to show a gameboy UI for controlling the gameboy via any device with a browser and WiFi.
